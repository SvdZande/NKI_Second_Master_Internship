#Novel _ex vivo_ Culturing Techniques to Study Spatial Patterns in the Human Intratumoral Immune Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade
This project focuses on deciphering immune responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in a spatial manner. To investigate this, we have developed two platforms to achieve this: the patient-derived tumour fragment (PDTF) platform, established in Voabil et al. (2021), and the patient-derived tumour slice (PDTS) platform established in this project. This repository contains the R scripts used to analyse flow cytometry and LEGENDPLEX data gathered in this project.
